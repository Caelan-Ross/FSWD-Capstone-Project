# Deadlines

## Wednesday, July 19 - Elaboration

1. Discuss with the client what their goals are, including details of the products in question and what considerations need to be made during planning for use cases (what problems need to be solved, what procedures need to be optimized). Remember to include branding details (colour palette) and accessibility concerns (colourblind users, font sizing for vision impairment, etc).
2. Form a scope document (./docs/Scope.md) that outlines what is in-scope, and what is out-of-scope, and confirm this outline with the instructor, and then the client.
3. Form a WBS (work breakdown structure) document (./docs/WBS.md) that will formalize what tasks need to be completed, and what tasks prerequire other tasks. Review this with the instructor.
4. Form a draft entity relationship diagram and review this with the instructor.

## Thursday, July 27 - Initial Design & Project Skeleton

1. Form draft screens for the major use cases of your application. Review these with the instructor, and then with the client one a "final" draft has been formed.
2. Implement a project skeleton with basic frontend and backend routes defined according to your use cases.

## Sunday, July 30 - Design Change Requests & Database

1. Accept change requests to your draft screens from the client over 1-3 iterations. Ensure the client is content with them.
2. Implement Entity Framework into your backend so that the database (following the entity relationship diagram) is implemented and can be run using `dotnet ef database update`.

## Sunday, August 6 - Core Functionality

1. Implement the basics of each main screen by developing components and backend functionality as necessary. Layout isn't important at this stage so long as the functionality can be tested.
2. Write basic unit tests in a second backend project to confirm any data formatting is working as intended.
3. Discuss with the client what equipment will be necessary to deploy the project. Consider budget options with a road to upgrade (such as a used office computer as a server with an SSD upgrade and Linux).

## Sunday, August 13 - Core Layout & Secondary Functionality

1. Implement a layout for the main screens reflecting your draft screen designs.
2. Implement the basics of each secondary and tertiary screen by developing components and backend functionality as necessary.
3. Perform a demonstration for the client of the main screen functionality, and note any change requests.

## Sunday, August 20 - Finalized Layout & Functionality

1. Implement any client change requests from the previous week.
2. Implement a layout for all screens reflecting your draft screen designs.
3. Ensure responsive designs are working as intended.
4. Go through each use case as a workflow, testing to ensure each is functional as intended.
5. Perform a demonstration for the client of any implemented change requests and functionality not yet demonstrated, and note any change requests.
6. Schedule an in-person meeting with the client and instructor for the following week for implementation. Ensure any required equipment has been acquired by the client.

## Sunday, August 27 - Implementation

1. Implement any final change requests.
2. If possible, perform dry-run implementations at home to familiarize yourselves with the process.
3. Meet with the client and instructor and implement the system.
4. Make note of any hiccups during implementation, and schedule a follow-up if deemed necessary.
5. Keep your eyes open and respond promptly to any questions or concerns the client may have of the implementation.

## Sunday, September 6 - Patching

1. Work to implement fixes for any bugs discovered in the use of the newly implemented system.
2. Schedule an in-person follow-up if necessary to update the system.
