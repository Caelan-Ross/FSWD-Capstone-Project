# Team Norms

## Communication and Collaboration Method(s)
The primary method of communication will be via a group chat on WhatsApp messenger. Group members will check the chat at least once per day for the duration of the project. If a group member cannot be reached via WhatsApp, a text message (SMS) and/or email will be sent. Google Drive (Docs) and Github will be the primary method of collaboration on assignments. It is okay for a group member to ask for help from the rest of the group if they are unable to complete their assigned work by the soft deadline (see Expectations). It is preferable to ask for help rather than missing the soft deadline. Group members are free to contact program administration with any questions or concerns at any time, but resolving any grievances internally should be attempted before involving administration.

## Punctuality & Attendance
Expectations of attendance will ideally be established at least one day prior to a potential meeting time. If someone is unable to attend a meeting or class time, or will be late, they are expected to let the group members know as soon as possible, ideally at least the day before the scheduled meeting but at minimum 30 minutes before the class in the case of missing it completely.

The absentee will be responsible for catching up (including reading the meeting summary) and completing their assigned work. Examples of valid reasons for being absent are medical situations, time-sensitive or non-reschedulable appointments, work schedule conflicts, transit/vehicle issues, natural disasters and family emergencies. Examples of invalid excuses are oversleeping, “not feeling like it” and waiting in line for Starbucks.

Failure to notify the group or provide a valid reason for the tardiness or absence will result in a strike (see Strikes) signed by the remaining members of the group.


## Meeting Times, Locations & Management
Class time will be our primary meeting times and location. Meetings outside of class will be determined and planned as needed or requested. Meetings may be used for team discussions, to work on parts of the project, client discussions, etc.

If not all members are required for a given meeting, they will not be required to attend, this will be determined when the meeting is planned a day in advance. A minimum of $number people (majority of group) are required to agree for any decision affecting the project to be made. No tasks can be assigned to a group member if that group member is not present, or at least contacted to agree to the terms.

When a meeting time is agreed upon, the meeting must be posted to WhatsApp with the time, place, required group members and a description of the tasks to be worked on. If a meeting needs to be canceled, a reasonable effort must be made to contact all group members. Typically this would be a message on WhatsApp followed by an email to any member that doesn’t agree to the cancellation therein.


## Expectations
Group members are expected to agree to a reasonable portion of the work, although it will never be an exact split, no group member should refuse to do any of the work and expect credit. Refusal to partake in their share of the work will be considered grounds for a strike.

Ideally, two soft deadlines will be set for assignments (minimum one). The number of soft deadlines for a milestone, as well as their dates, will be determined as a team. If a member fails to hand in their work before the first soft deadline, or if they do and their work is not considered up to standards by the rest of the group (doesn’t meet the criteria, doesn’t function), they will get one chance to remedy the issue before the second soft deadline or final deadline. If the member then fails to have their work completed (or redone to a satisfactory level) before the second soft deadline, the member will be removed from the group in accordance with the removal policy. All program student expectations and policies apply during group work, meetings and communication.


## Conflict Resolution
We will discuss all issues that arise as a team and attempt to resolve them amicably. Should a disagreement prove impossible to resolve via discussion, a vote will take place. In the event of a tie, the team will consult with program administration. In the event of a small disagreement that does not impact the client/project in a significant way, the winning party will be decided by a game of team chess between both parties if time permits, otherwise the issue will be discussed with program administration. The winning party will resolve the issue in their chosen manner (as stated prior to the competition). Severe infractions (violating program policies, hateful language, etc) will result in member removal in accordance with the member removal policy.

## Strikes
A strike is considered a warning by the group. Strikes will be recorded in a dedicated, version-controlled document. If a member accumulates three strikes,  they will be removed from the group in accordance with the member removal policy. Any action that breaks the law or program policies will be delegated to program administration or law enforcement to take action.

## Member Removal Policy
If a member is to be removed from the group, evidence of the relevant infraction(s) will be presented to the instructor by the remaining members of the group. Upon approval by the instructor, the member will be ejected from the group and their status in the project will be addressed between them and program administration.
