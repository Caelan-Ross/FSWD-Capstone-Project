# Project Specification
The project will be an internal inventory management system. This includes processing acquisitions, logging quantity on hand and generating invoices.

## Requirements:
- Track inventory of ~80 items, both new and reconditioned.
- Track purchase orders of new items and allow them to be verified upon delivery (and added to inventory).
- Create invoices under a customer's phone number and allow them to be searched.
- Allow reconditioned inventory to be added.

## Stretch Goals:
- Generate and print QR codes for individual asset / warranty tracking.
- Email customers a copy of their invoice.
- Containerization.
- Redundant deployment to multiple boxes.
- Public-facing website update.

## Notes: 

- There is no public facing component of this application, unless all goals are met with plenty of time to spare.
- Interface will be primarily interacted with on mobile / tablet.
- Interface must be usable by less tech-savvy individuals.
- No existing digital system for this is in place, it is entirely pen and paper.
- No retroactive record entry is required, only deployment-forward.
- The application will run on a unit on the premises and be accessible via network connection to the premises' wifi.
- In-person deployment will be included, time permitting. The instructor will be on site with you at all times to assist and facilitate. 
- You will be recommending equipment to the client (which the instructor can assist with if necessary).
